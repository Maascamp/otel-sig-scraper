00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.200
Pablo Baeyens: Alright, let's get started. Welcome everyone to the Collector SIG meeting.

2
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.300
Pablo Baeyens: First item on the agenda today is the OTLP HTTP export improvements.

3
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:18.400
Pablo Baeyens: I've been working on adding partial success response support to the OTLP HTTP receiver.

4
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:25.600
Pablo Baeyens: The idea is that when a batch of spans comes in and some fail validation, we can tell the client exactly which ones were accepted.

5
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:32.100
Dmitrii Anoshin: That sounds great. How does this interact with the retry logic on the exporter side?

6
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:40.300
Pablo Baeyens: Good question. The exporter would need to understand the partial success response and only retry the rejected items, not the whole batch.

7
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:48.200
Dmitrii Anoshin: I'm a bit concerned about backward compatibility. What happens if an older exporter receives a partial success response?

8
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:55.100
Pablo Baeyens: We're making it opt-in. By default, the receiver will still return full success or full failure. You'd need to enable partial success in the config.

9
00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:02.300
Bogdan Drutu: I think that's the right approach. We should also consider how this works with the batch processor.

10
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:10.400
Yang Song: On a related note, I've finished the batch processor memory improvements. We're seeing 40% less memory allocation in benchmarks.

11
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.200
Pablo Baeyens: That's excellent, Yang. Can you open a PR for review?

12
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.900
Yang Song: Sure, I'll have it up by end of day.
